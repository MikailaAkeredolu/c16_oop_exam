### Use the UML above to answer the questions in your main method

> Create an array named **shoppingBag** that contains the 3 clothing items below:
 - clothingItem1 is a small pair of Jeans that cost $20.00
 - clothingItem2 is a medium sized T-shirt that cost $8.00
 - clothingItem3 is a large hat that only cost $2.00

> Leverage the **calculateSubTotal** method to print out the subtotal of the clothing items in the shoppingBag.
- **Sample Expected output** ```Subtotal of clothing items: $30.0```

>  Create 2 different student objects with the info below:
 - student1's name is Mike, he wears a Large and has the same shoppingBag of clothing items.
 - student2's name is Jane, she wears a Small and also has the same shoppingBag of clothing items.
   
 > Create an array named **listOfStudents** that stores our two students (student1 and student2)
 - Use the **printInfo** method to print out each student's info for every student stored in the **listOfStudents** 
 - **Sample Expected output**
   ```
      Student ID 1 :  Student Name: Mike
      Student ID 2 :  Student Name: Jane
   ```

> Invoke the **printStudentCounter** to display the number of studnet objects that have been created thus far
- **Sample Expected output** ```We have created 2 students in our database successfully ```

> Modify your HourlyEmployee class by overloading the constructor to include an hourly employees's hourlyPay and hoursWorked when instantiated
- Use the overloaded constructor to create a new hourlyEmployee named Alex, that works 40hours a week and makes $20 per hour. Alex's clothing size is a small, and she too has the same list of clothing items in the shoppingBag.
  
> Modify your Manager class by overloading the constructor to include a manger's salary when instantiated
- Use the overloaded constructor to create a new manager named Terry, that makes $100k, his size is a large, and he too has the same list of clothing items in his shoppingBag
  
- Now inside the main method, print out the manager's info with the **printIfo** method
- **Sample Expected Output** 
```
Terry makes 10000.0 and his shopping bag consist of the following clothing items: Levi Jeans T-shirt Hat 
```
