### Use the UML above to answer the questions in your main method

> Create an array named **shoppingBag** that contains the 3 clothing items below:
 - clothingItem1 is a small pair of Jeans that cost $20.00
 - clothingItem2 is a medium sized T-shirt that cost $8.00
 - clothingItem3 is a large hat that only cost $2.00

> Leverage the **calculateSubTotal** method to print out the subtotal of the clothing items in the shoppingBag
